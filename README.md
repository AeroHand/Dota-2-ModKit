# Dota 2 Particle Forker

A GUI to fork decompiled Dota 2 Particles into your addons. This will automatically change the child references after the particles are copied over :)

## Installation

1. Download ParticleForker.rar and extract it, or you can build from the .sln in WindowsFormsApplication1.
2. If you already have the decompiled particles, move them over to the ParticlesForker folder. **Rename the decompiled particles folder to decompiled_particles**. If you don't have the decompiled particles, this program comes with decompiled_particles.rar which you can extract.
3. Open ParticleForker.exe

* After you copy over particles, you may have to restart the Workshop Tools to see them in the asset browser. I usually have to do this.

Thanks to ToraxXx for decompiling all of the particles. https://github.com/toraxxx

## Notes

* This is my first C# project, so the code definitely isn't the greatest!
